# Power-prod-cons_dashboard
Hi
This dashboard project showcases a power production and consumption dataset dynamically. The dataset has been taken from Kaggle. It shows the power production and consumption of a particular country for every day from 01 January 2019 to 12 March 2023.

You can download the Power BI file and run the dashboard. Also, a video showing a demo is also attached for easy reference.
